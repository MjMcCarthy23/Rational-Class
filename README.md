# Rational-Class
My first program that uses C++ classes!
The program uses classes and operator overloading to perform basic arithmetic calculations on rational numbers.
Code I learned in this assignment:
- Default, overloaded and copy constructors/ when each is used. 
- Constructor initialization lists and constructor delegation.
- Operator overloading assignment operators, arithmetic operators, and ostream operator.

I plan to update the program so the rational's will be in simplest form.
Any suggestions on improving my code are welcome! I'm eager to improve.
